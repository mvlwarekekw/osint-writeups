We used his TripAdivsor username to find his account on [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:6ewufg2fztglgresvyyx56m7). Using the article we found at the start we determine that some members of APT 509 were arrested on the 25th of June 2024. 

Analyzing his posts on BlueSky, we find a [post](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:6ewufg2fztglgresvyyx56m7) about his stay in tokyo with an image of a ticket. The ticket reads "Chanko & Wanko" in Japanese, which we find with a quick google search.
