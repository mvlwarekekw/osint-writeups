*ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· â€“ Cet enquÃªteur semble Ãªtre un vÃ©ritable alliÃ© ! Comme vous avez pu le constater, il est parvenu Ã  extraire des fichiers sensibles concernant APT-509. Nos experts ont rÃ©ussi Ã  identifier un compte quâ€™il utilise en ligne, et voici la description quâ€™il y a laissÃ©e :*

*If you're here, it's because you too want to put an end to the 509 menace. GL! I've deliberately left some information about a key character in the group (#A) on the internet. You'll find it useful !*

*Pouvez-vous retrouver ces donnÃ©es et, grÃ¢ce Ã  elles, potentiellement identifier un autre site-web utilisÃ© par APT-509 ?*

In the last challenge we found the user of an ally, 3ND0FW47CH509. Using the first part of the user 3ND0FW47CH, we can find a pastebin account.
The pastebin account links to a paste, which reveals a Base64-encoded string: "bzI0cHN3d2Jwanp5NmhjMzZtZmJ4cHk2eHFheXk3Y3RhNHc1eGZvb3J0d3ZlaGIyNzJlZWVmeWQ=".
Decoding this reveals a partial onion URL: o24pswwbpjzy6hc36mfbxpy6xqayy7cta4w5xfoortwvehb272eeefyd
