In the chats we saw an image of a place that looks african, as well as a message "I have to go on a flight in 10 minutes" (gives us a time estimate around 7am). Using RIS we're able to get the exact [restaurant](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Dar+Chef/@31.6254125,-7.9861441,3a,109.9y,90t/data=!3m8!1e2!3m6!1sAF1QipN5K0ZTFIAiT6Jnwd0gz-WDdTtDOfRBU8Z0H62X!2e10!3e12!6shttps:%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fp%2FAF1QipN5K0ZTFIAiT6Jnwd0gz-WDdTtDOfRBU8Z0H62X%3Dw130-h86-k-no!7i719!8i474!4m7!3m6!1s0xdafee4164763cbb:0x2665fb75a19356ae!8m2!3d31.6253868!4d-7.9861838!10e5!16s%2Fg%2F11dxph3fp2?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDUyMS4wIKXMDSoJLDEwMjExNDUzSAFQAw%3D%3D) in Marrakech.

He mentions his location: `Roissy`, with the closest airport being Paris-Charles de Gaulle airport (CDG). Therefore, we have to find a flight from CDG to RAK on the 11th March at around 7am.
We found flight number `U24663`, maybe you'll find a different one :)
