*üá´üá∑ - Apr√®s l‚Äôarrestation d'une partie de leurs membres en 2024, les activit√©s du groupe APT 509 sont en net d√©clin. Leur attaque pr√©vue cette m√™me ann√©e contre la ville de Geelong, en Australie, a √©chou√©. Par cons√©quent, leur tr√©sorerie a √©t√© directement impact√©e. Pour tenter de se relancer, le groupe envisage d√©sormais une cyberattaque contre un √©tablissement fran√ßais.*
*Pouvez-vous identifier quelle entreprise est vis√©e par APT 509 ?*

*üá¨üáß - Following the arrest of several of its members in 2024, the activities of the APT 509 group have significantly declined. Their planned attack that same year on the city of Geelong, Australia, failed. As a result, their financial resources have been directly affected. In an attempt to recover, the group is now planning a cyberattack against a French organization.*
*Can you identify which company is being targeted by APT 509? (company name)*

In a previous challenge we found the telegram channel, APT509TMP. There's a drive link to another CryptPad, this time protected by a password. In one of the conversations between November and Bravo, they mentioned a password: `kmMBRAS9J&$jonnF`

There's one folder that stands out: Target. It contains a drawing of a town which has a train station on the left and a red arrow pointing at their target.
Checking multiple cities in eastern France (title) we finally find the the town: Riems, which matches all criteria. Using some attributes from the drawing, we can find that their next target is the CIC, also known as the Cr√©dit Industriel et Commercial.
