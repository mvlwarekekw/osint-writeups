For this challenge you'll need a lot of information from previous challenges:

- Leas threads account (reveals AirBnB hosts name -> Nicolas)
- Leas sells clothes online (find her Vinted account -> Picture of the view of her room)

Using this information we can find her AirBnB with some google dorks:

`"Nicolas" + "eiffel" site:airbnb.com` using the Images the tab might help.

The approximate location is around ``48.86032154015461, 2.311215752980118``

Using Google Earth we find the view of the apartment to be this onto building: 48.860879328081396, 2.3098053821037543-

Flag: `48.860864182917226, 2.310504254742259` (that's way too many decimals btw)
