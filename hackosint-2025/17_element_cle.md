In one of the previous challenges we find Lise's website: https://mymemoriegram.xyz/ where she posts a lot of stuff. Useless stuff. What we actually need is the content of the `robots.txt` file, which is usually meant for scrapers, today its also meant for us.
We can see an endpoint called `/private` which we can only access with the user agent `bravo`. You can use whichever tool you like to change your user agent, e.g. a chrome extension or burp suite. In the `/private` we find a lot of screenshots.

In one of the conversations they were talking about a fishing app. They also sent a logo of the supposed application. Using the name and logo we can try various combinations on different app stores. Finally we find the app "FishingApp", with the ID `com.hackosint.myapplication`.
