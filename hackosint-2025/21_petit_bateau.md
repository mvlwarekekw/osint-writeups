ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§ â€“ Mike seems to be a fishing enthusiast, and like all good fishermen, he's very well equipped! Can you find the identifier of the boat he uses (MMSI code) ?

Looking at his bio on absolu peche there's a boat emoji followed by the words `Seashell Injection`. yea, thats his boats name.. ha.

Looking it up on marinetraffic.com we actually find something: https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:9565794/mmsi:912010044/imo:0/vessel:SEASHELL_INJECTION

We can confirm that this is the correct boat by opening our eyes and starring at the call sign - APT509.
