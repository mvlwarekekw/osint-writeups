Back on the website we can first check the /robots.txt. We can see that there's a /index.php page, which we weren't aware of up to this point. On that page we can find a lot of documents, the one we need is called invitation-T-509.txt.
There's a location: XXX - ND.3QQB, which is a map code. The map code resolves in 46.017495, 1.207456.
