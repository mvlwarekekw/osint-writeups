Using this newly acquired username we can once again check all sites using e.g. WhatsMyName.app, some pages requiring manual checking, e.g. Bluesky. Speaking of bluesky, here's his account: https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:rctv6tcirholkedfeetvxbf4

Keep the bluesky acccount at the back of your mind there's a couple hints spread you'll need. The one we're looking for is the drive link in the image of one of his posts. Unfortunately there's part of it missing. Checking the accounts he's following, we can figure out he's following a cloud storage company. What a coincidence, really.

Constructing the full link we get this: [https://cryptpad.fr/drive/#/2/drive/view/f3YGBpPsdLVDxwpvH+PfWsHBS2nNHpOgLwGr-VP9cHI/](https://cryptpad.fr/drive/#/2/drive/view/f3YGBpPsdLVDxwpvH+PfWsHBS2nNHpOgLwGr-VP9cHI/ "https://cryptpad.fr/drive/#/2/drive/view/f3YGBpPsdLVDxwpvH+PfWsHBS2nNHpOgLwGr-VP9cHI/")

Usually I like to get an overview of the whole drive setup, so I have somewhat of an idea where everything is located. For this task we'll need the `509/F-memory-2023-2024` folder, in which all his chats with F are stored.

Scanning through the chats we find the first message to be sent on the 7th September 2023
