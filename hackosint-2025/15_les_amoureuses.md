Scanning through Leas account again we find a prename: Lise, as well as her complaining that her girlfriend is laughing with someone else while playing games called "JLMaigot".

This user leads us to a chess.com account: https://www.chess.com/member/JLmaigot, where we find the user ChessM8_Saunier of a person she played against a couple of times.
The chess account bio has a link to a linktree: https://linktr.ee/m8_lsaunier, which includes the surname.
